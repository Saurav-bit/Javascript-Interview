SCOPE
var vs let vs const

1)
anything inside a function is function SCOPE

function(){

    //function scope
}

{
    
//block scope

}


2)
var is function scope
let const is block SCOPE

illegal Shadowing

when we shadow a var with let 
gives a error already been declared

3)Declaration

we cannot re-declare let and const in same scope 
but var can


4)Hoisting


there is a creation Phase and a execution Phase
in creation Phase all the variables are declared with undefined value

in execution phase their value is initialised 

Js moves all the function and variable Declaration to the top which is called Hoisting.
 

 Temporal Dead Zone
  happens in let and const
  state between Declaration and initialization

  term to describe the scope where the variables are in the scope but they are not yet declared;
